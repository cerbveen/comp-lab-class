GROMACS reminds you: "It seems likely that significant software contributions to existing scientific software projects are not likely to be rewarded through the traditional reputation economy of science. Together these factors provide a reason to expect the over-production of independent scientific software packages, and the underproduction of collaborative projects in which later academics build on the work of earlier ones." (Howison & Herbsleb)

Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 13.5%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 74%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 10.0%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 1.073
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 4.5 %

NOTE: 10.0 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      You might want to use dynamic load balancing (option -dlb.)
      You can also consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.

MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank 0 in communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD
with errorcode 1.

NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes.
You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on
exactly when Open MPI kills them.
