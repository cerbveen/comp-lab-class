    "- Run at least 10 ns and check convergence of the FES with `sum_hills`. Is your bias factor and height okay or do you need to change it? Or run longer?\n",
    "\t- `sum_hills` should produce a grid file which you can plot with imshow. Make a free energy surface with labeled axes and color bar. This time, add contour lines. This should look more like a surface than from replica exchange! \n",
    "\t- Bonus: If you use the `--stride` function to get many surfaces, can you make an animated gif of the free energy surface filling in?\n",
