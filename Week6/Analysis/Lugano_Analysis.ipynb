    "The grid file has the bias. Plot the negative of the energy column in the grid file, does it look like the FES? Is it slightly different? Perhaps scaled by a constant that you can figure out?\n",
    "Do Lugano exercise 2.\n",
    "[*optional Do Lugano exercise 3 - try at least 3 different bias factors to see how this affects your results.\n",
    "\t- Show the exploration of phi for these different bias factors, what do you notice?\n",
    "\t- What is the smallest you can pick where the barriers are not surmounted?\n",
    "\t- Plot the final Free Energy for each one, does it look the same?*]\n",
    "- Run at least 10 ns and check convergence of the FES with `sum_hills`. Is your bias factor and height okay or do you need to change it? Or run longer?\n",
    "\t- `sum_hills` should produce a grid file which you can plot with imshow. Make a free energy surface with labeled axes and color bar. This time, add contour lines. This should look more like a surface than from replica exchange! \n",
    "\t- Bonus: If you use the `--stride` function to get many surfaces, can you make an animated gif of the free energy surface filling in?\n",
